<h1 class="page-title">About Us</h1>

<p>In the spring 2019, our founder and CEO Caitie Zajko suffered three flat tires on her car due to the rampant potholes in the city of Pittsburgh. This inspired her to found Potholr, an app to crowdsource the locations of potholes and pressure municipalities to repair them. Since then, we have grown and our app now functions anywhere in the United States.</p>
